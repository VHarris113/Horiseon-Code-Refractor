# Horiseon-Code-Refractor
<!-- The CSS held the bulk of the issues I'm finding. A lot of the code is jumbled together and written out, very redundant. I was able to put similarly formatted selectors together, so they'd be formatted the same.

I also added non-coding lines to show division and organization with the different selectors.

For the HTML, I changed the website title to Horiseon. There was also a missing ID element that needed to be fixed, so when the top link was clicked for "Search Engine Optimization" it would actually travel to that part of the page.

I also turned the final paragraph from a <p> to a <p2>, so the color I changed the original paragraph in CSS wouldn't be white. That way, it can show up easily on the background.
